> this is a port which uses [redux][r] with the [redux-future][rf] and [redux-either][re] middleware

## Thoughts

This is a "practical" application built with react and functional techniques. React components are "impure" and our model stays pure (although there's a bit of cheating in utils as it's a hodge podge).


## Install

First run:

```
npm install
```

Then run each of these commands in a different terminal window. One for webpack, one for babel-node:

```
npm run dev
```

```
npm run server
```

[r]: http://redux.js.org/
[rf]: https://github.com/stoeffel/redux-future
[re]: https://github.com/stoeffel/redux-either
